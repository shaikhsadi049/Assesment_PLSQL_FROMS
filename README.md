Stage 3: Hands-On Practical Test (60–90 mins)
Test Options (Choose 1–2 Tasks):

Evaluation Criteria:
Correct use of triggers
Code readability
Validation logic
✅ Option B: PL/SQL Challenge
Given a sales table, write a PL/SQL procedure to generate a monthly summary (total sales per region) and store the results in a separate summary table.
Evaluation Criteria:
Correct use of procedures, cursors, and error handling
Efficient and optimized code
